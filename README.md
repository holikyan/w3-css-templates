# W3Schools CSS Templates Repository

Welcome to the W3Schools CSS Templates Repository! This repository contains a collection of CSS templates inspired by W3Schools tutorials, organized in a structured manner for easy exploration and implementation.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a structured layout where each nested directory represents a specific W3Schools CSS template implementation. Here's a breakdown of the structure:

- **Root Directory:** Contains subdirectories representing individual W3Schools CSS templates.
  - **[Template 1]:** Directory containing files for the first W3Schools CSS template implementation.
    - `index.html`: HTML file for the template's webpage.
    - `style.css`: CSS file for styling the template.
    - `assets/`: Folder containing any necessary assets (images, fonts, etc.) for the template.
  - **[Template 2]:** Directory for the second W3Schools CSS template, following a similar structure.
  - **[Template 3]:** Directory for the third W3Schools CSS template, and so on.

If you have a live server extension installed in your code editor (e.g., VS Code), you can simply right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" to view the template in your browser.
6. **Navigate Between Templates:** Repeat steps 3-5 for each template directory to explore different W3Schools CSS template implementations.
